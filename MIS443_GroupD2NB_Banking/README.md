## Selected Schema
**Banking** - a relational database simulating a commercial banking management system, consisting of five related tables: `branches`, `customers`, `accounts`, `loans`, and `transactions`.

## Project Description
This project recreates the Banking schema from SQL Practice Online in PostgreSQL using pgAdmin 4. The group designed and implemented five relational tables with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, populated them with CSV data, and completed all 30 SQL practice questions covering filtering, sorting, joins, aggregation, subqueries, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

## At a Glance
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total Tables | 5 |
| SQL Questions Solved | 30 |
| Branches (Records) | 5 |
| Customers (Records) | 7 |
| Accounts (Records) | 8 |
| Transactions (Records) | 8 |
| Loans (Records) | 4 |
| SQL Concepts Applied | JOINs, Subqueries, Window Functions, CTEs |

## Tools Used
- **PostgreSQL** - database management system
- **pgAdmin 4** - database creation and query execution
- **SQL Practice Online** - source schema and question set
- **Microsoft Word** - group report
- **CSV files** - data storage for each table
- **GitHub** - project publishing and version control

## Instructions for Running the SQL Scripts (How to Run)  
**Step 1 - Set up the database**  
Open pgAdmin 4, connect to your PostgreSQL server, and run `codes/01_create_database.sql` from the default `postgres` connection. This creates the `banking` database used throughout the project.

**Step 2 - Build the schema**  
Switch your connection to the newly created `banking` database, then execute `codes/02_create_tables_relationships.sql`. This script defines all five tables along with their primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

**Step 3 - Load the data**  
Run `codes/03_insert_data.sql` to populate every table with the project's sample records. The raw values used here are the same ones found in the `data/` folder, provided separately as CSV files for reference or re-import.

**Step 4 - Run the practice queries**  
Finally, execute `codes/04_questions_01_30.sql` to run through all 30 SQL practice questions in sequence and inspect their output in the Query Tool.

> Note: Code formatting may vary slightly between questions in `codes/04_questions_01_30.sql`, as each question was written by the team member responsible for it.

> Scripts must be run strictly in this order (01 → 02 → 03 → 04), since each step depends on objects created in the previous one.

> Ensure the CSV files in `data/` remain in the same relative folder when running the import script, as file paths are referenced from `data/`.
